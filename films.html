          <strong>Two friends, a radio, and a quest for alien contact.</strong> <br>
          <em>Higher Living</em> is a short film about unconditional friendship, curiosity, and enjoying the little things. Created during an off-campus study in Los Angeles, I co-wrote the script, gathered most of the props, worked as a secondary editor, and handled all sound: recording, design, scoring, and editing. The film was shot in just two days (eight hours total) on a super tight budget. We also had to film discreetly because of permit issues, shooting in the Hollywood Hills near Griffith Park.

            Another fantastic learning experience. It was my first time working on a collaborative film, and I picked up so much about sound design, recording, and editing. We could not find an actual radio, so we used a little heater I found at a thrift store, with a knitting needle taped to it. We found our amazing actors on Backstage and had a great time working with them.

          <em>Lingering</em> is a short, experimental film I created as the final project for my Digital Foundations course at Carleton College. It explores paranoia, loneliness, and resignation. I wrote, directed, edited, and handled all of the sound design and scoring. The film was shot over two days in the fall of 2023, mostly in the arboretum and our dorm. This was the film that made me realize I love filmmaking and want to keep creating more. I’m proud of what I made, especially for my first film.

            This film was a huge learning experience. I had never made a whole short film before, and I had to really kick my creative senses and time management skills into overdrive. I recorded much of the audio using an old thrifted tape recorder. I also used a lot of Tascam field recordings to build the eerie atmosphere. Shooting in the arboretum and my dorm with friend and star, Owen, made the whole process super rewarding and fun.
